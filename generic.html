								<h2>Problem</h2>
								<p>In 2014, over 50, 000 people were killed due to medical errors in the US alone and it is estimated that the number of deaths due to medical errors is ten times more worldwide. Inaccuracies in medical records, miscommunication between patients and doctors and mistakes with prescriptions given to patients all contribute to this death. A lot of these mishaps occur as a result of how notes on patients’ records are recorded. Since the notes are handwritten, the officers that deal with those records often misread doctors’ notes, thus resulting in medical errors. Medical errors aside, these paper-based medical records are always at risk of being destroyed or lost in the aftermaths of natural
								disasters. One example involves the recent floods that occurred on the East Coast of Malaysia. Many medical establishments such as clinics and hospitals were damaged resulting in medical records also being destroyed.</p>
								<p>Another issue with the current system is that the current process of retrieving medical records is often tedious and time-consuming. This is because the medical records are kept by health care institutions and patients or their family members need to apply to retrieve the records. This is problematic in cases where the records need to be accessed instantaneously during emergencies. As a result, whenever a patient is admitted to a new hospital, a new record is written and any previous treatments and prescriptions are recorded based on what the patient provides, hence resulting in inaccurate data; this process also causes a patient to own multiple medical records. Other than these above issues, doctors do not have the means to monitor a patient’s progress when the patient is outside the premises of the health care institution. As a result, it is challenging for the doctors to track and analyses the patient’s progress and performance with the given prescriptions.
</p>
								<h2>Solution</h2>
								<p>The solution is to bridge this gap between patient and care provider, by giving more control and power to the patient as the sole owner of its own medical record. SmartCare wants to empower patient with mobility and accessibility to their current medical record thru a secure cloud-based mobile personal health record solution. Through this application, we aim to allow medical data to be accessed anytime and anywhere by authorized users of the application. Getting care from/to different places with updated health record has never been this simpler.
Care provider would also benefit by getting important and vital information about his/her patient, even before the patient visit. And they can keep track of their patient health progress instantly.
The biggest impact would be to telemedicine. SmartCare can empower telemedicine to its upmost potential. Diabetics for example can save hours from going to clinics, they can simply track his blood glucose level at home, and only to the clinics/hospital when necessary.
